# Knee-Rehabilitation-Recovery-Analysis
This project analyzes my knee rehabilitation recovery using real, self-collected data recorded daily after surgery. The goal is to apply core Data Mining, Time Series Analysis, and Machine Learning techniques to understand recovery patterns, identify effective rehabilitation behaviors, and predict future knee flexion.
